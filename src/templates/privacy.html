  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: July 1, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. Your privacy is important to me. This policy explains how I collect, use, and protect any personal information you provide through the contact form on this website.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>If you choose to contact me using the form, I may collect the following personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Message content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>I use this information solely to respond to your inquiry or message. I do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Transmission</h2>
  <p>Please note that your message is transmitted electronically to me via a private Discord webhook. While I take reasonable steps to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>I will retain your contact message for as long as needed to address your inquiry. After that, it will be deleted. If you wish to have your information removed, please contact me at <a href="mailto:contact@antcantu.com">contact@antcantu.com</a> and I will promptly delete it.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>This website does not use cookies to track personal information and does not run third-party advertising or analytics.</p>

  <h2>5a. Use of Cloudflare</h2>
  <p>This website uses Cloudflare, a content delivery network and security provider, to help protect and accelerate the website.

  <h2>5b. Rate Limiting</h2>
  <p>To protect this website from abusive or excessive requests, I use rate-limiting technology. This temporarily processes visitors’ IP addresses to limit repeated requests. No personal data beyond IP addresses is stored long-term as part of this process.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Union or California, you may have additional rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Please email me at <a href="mailto:contact@antcantu.com">contact@antcantu.com</a> to exercise those rights.</p>
